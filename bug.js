This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component in conjunction with the `useAsyncEffect` hook from `react`.  The camera preview will sometimes fail to render, resulting in a blank screen. This often happens after a change in screen orientation or after the component remounts (e.g., after navigating back to the screen).  The error isn't always accompanied by a console message making debugging tricky.  The code seems correct, but the preview just doesn't appear.
